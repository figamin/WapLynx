WapLynx was the previous frontend for [wapchan.org](https://wapchan.org), a LynxChan based imageboard.
It was retired due to being a hack job in a lot of ways (was originally based on a frontend from a different board, and then extensively modified)
For actual modern site usage, take a look at [WapLynx Neo](https://github.com/figamin/WapLynx-Neo)
## note
This repo used to be based on gitgud and mirrored here, but I reversed that. Any old commits published under "ranchan" are mine, as I previously used a different name to reflect the name I generally use on that site. 
While this frontend is no longer in use on wapchan, it is on here for legacy reasons.
