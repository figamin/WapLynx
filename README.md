waplynx is the frontend for [wapchan.org](https://wapchan.org), a LynxChan based imageboard.
## note
This repo used to be based on gitgud and mirrored here, but I reversed that. Any old commits published under "ranchan" are mine, as I previously used a different name to reflect the name I generally use on that site. 

## features
  - WAP-FM
  - Slightly revised layout
  - More to come
