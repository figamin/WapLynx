      <p>wapchan at it's heart is a board about community, and this is reflected in the way anons from all over the net hear about it. i don't belive in buying adspace around the internet for my board, and instead want to grow it the same way many classic sites did: through word of mouth.</p>
    </fieldset>
    <fieldset id="settingsFieldset" class="spacerFieldset">
      <legend>some guidelines</legend>
      <p>if you're posting about wap on 4chan:<ul>
        <li>try to keep it to retro/2000s threads on /a/ or imageboard threads on /g/</li>
        <li>don't spam it incessantly, this gives us a bad look</li>
        <li>use banners as images</li>
      </ul>
      if you're posting about wap on another imageboard:<ul>
        <li>try to start off with a "hello" or "greetings" sort of post in a meta board, if they have one. we want to work with other imageboards whenever possible</li>
        <li>talk about the community</li>
      </ul>
      if you're posting about wap on another IRC/BBS server:<ul>
        <li>same sort of guidelines as the above case, just mentioning the equivalent wap version</li>
      </ul>
      <p>if you're posting about wap on social media:<ul>
        <li>emphasize that wap isn't trying to be like other imageboards, and is going for more of a relaxed feel</li>
        <li>mention community events</li>
      </ul>
      this isn't some formal rules list, i mean you aren't paid shills or anything. but i feel these guidelines will help the board out.
      also: i don't personally hate all redditors or social media users. this may be a different take from how some other imageboards operate, but i'm open to partnering the site with other like minded communities, even if they aren't operating their own sites. we want to encourage users who don't usually post in these kinds of sites to participate, so keep an open attitude.
