      <legend>overview</legend>
      <p>currently, wapchan is entirely run by me, ranchan. however, as the board grows and this site
        gets more traffic, additional staff members would be nice to have around here to clean up spam and stay
        engaged with the community.
      </p>
    </fieldset>
    <fieldset id="settingsFieldset" class="spacerFieldset">
      <legend>positions</legend>
      <p>i am currently looking for a few moderators for the site. here are some guidelines<ul>
        <li>transparent moderation. if you want to speak on your opinions on aspects of the site, feel free
          to use the mod tag. this isnt like 4chan where you have to stay hidden always
        </li>
        <li>cleaning up spam, mostly other imageboards advertizing but occasionally obsene content attacks as well
        </li>
        <li>staying active and keeping up with the community</li>
        <li>possibly working with me on planning and coordinating site events</li>
        <li>if need be, you may get a similar position on the IRC server</li>
      </ul>
      this isn't meant to be anything fancy, but if you genuinely care about this site and want to keep it high quality, helping out in the moderation department goes a long way to making that a reality
      if you're posting about wap on another imageboard:
      
    </fieldset>
    <fieldset id="settingsFieldset" class="spacerFieldset">
      <legend>how to apply</legend>
      <p>to apply, you simply need to send an email answering the questions below to <a href="mailto:admin@wapchan.org">admin@wapchan.org</a>. it can be an anonymous email account, it's simply used on the site itself as part of your account in case you forget your password</p><ul>
        <li>give a short intro about yourself, no need to put down personal stuff just maybe how you got here</li>
        <li>how long have you been posting here?</li>
        <li>why do you want to help mod around here?</li>
        <li>favorite anime?</li>
      </ul>
      <p>if i think you're a good candidate i'll setup an informal interview with you on the IRC just to talk
      and get a feel for how you are. if things work out then you're in!</p>
