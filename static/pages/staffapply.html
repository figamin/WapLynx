      <p>As you've probably figured out by now, wapchan is a pretty comfy board to post on, especially with the fact that there are no captchas. However, this comes with the trade off that the site is much more suseptible to automated spam attacks, and I am not always around to clean them up. If you want to keep wapchan comfy and see the site continue to grow, I encourage you to apply for a staff position on here!

      <p>I am looking for mods to help keep this place tidy. Here's some guidelines:<ul>
        <li>Cleaning up automated spam, as well as other off topic posts.
        </li>
        <li>Potentially helping plan community events (if you've got the time)
        </li>
      </ul>
      Communication will be done through IRC/email (may change chat services in the future), no secret discord cabal or jannie board here. 
    </p>      
    </fieldset>
    <fieldset id="settingsFieldset" class="spacerFieldset">
      <legend>how to apply</legend>
      <p>To apply, send an email with the answers to the below questions to <a href="mailto:admin@wapchan.org">admin@wapchan.org</a>. You can use an anonymous account if you want, the email is just used in case you forget your password on the site.</p><ul>
        <li>Give a short intro about yourself, no need to put down personal stuff just maybe how you got here</li>
        <li>How long have you been posting here?</li>
        <li>Why do you want to help mod around here?</li>
        <li>Favorite retro media</li>
      </ul>
      <p>If things look good, I'll try and setup time to chat with you on IRC for a bit, just to make sure you're a good fit.</p>
